# Optimization_algos
Implementation of some classic optimization algorithms for my course of optimization in M1.

You can find in the file SVM my work on the support vector machines.
I implement in Julia three different methods to train the SVM:
barrier method, ACCPM for the primal and the coordinate descent
for the dual. They're not meant to be super efficient because the idea
was just to understand how these algorithms work.
For more details please refer to the file `SVM/SVM.ipynb`.
